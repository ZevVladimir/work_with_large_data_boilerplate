# work_with_large_data_boilerplate
-
Code for ENGL393 assignment to demonstrate how to work with large datasets.
Defines several functions that let you load and save data with pickle files as well as how to load and save .hdf5 files. Long term goal would be to further formalize this and add more functions for more cases 
to increase handling of large datasets.
